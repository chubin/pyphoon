        ASCII Art Phase of the Moon (Python version)
        
        ![Screenshots](http://igor.chub.in/pyphoon/screenshot.png)
        
        Based on the original version of Jef Poskanzer <jef@mail.acme.com>
        written in Pascal in 1979 (and later translated by himself into C, and now by me into Python).
